      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>Our vision is that food doesn't need to be harmful to the environment, have bad quality or be overpriced. Nowadays we live in a world with advanced technology and global cooperation. We don't need to make compromises for the environment anymore. We have the technology and ability to unite worldwide and create something bigger than what was possible before.</p>

      <span class="highlight">"We don't need to make compromises for the environment anymore."</span>

      <p>We provide a service which you can rely on. We understand that checking every detail of how the supplier has made the food you buy is tiresome and time consuming. The best thing is, when you buy from us you don't have to do any of that, because we have done it for you. </p>
      <p>But the road ahead of us wont be easy. There are still many things to do before our mind can rest and our vision is real. But if you choose to aid us in this dream, we come one step closer to make this world a better place.</p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>In the year of 2007 the three friends, Markus, Jonathan and Jonas sat in their favourite couch, staring plainlessly into the wall, when suddenly, Jonathan said: "The world is so messed up." Startled and a bit confused his two friends stared at him, but remained in silence. A few moments later Jonas said: "Someone should do something about it." Markus and Jonathan hummed in agreement, sighed and then continued to stare into the wall.</p>

      <span class="highlight">"Someone should do something about it."</span>

      <p>Throughout the years the friends continued to have this thought that someone ought to do something about the world, but never actually doing or thinking anything past that. Ten years later, in 2017 they sat in that same sofa again, staring plainlessly into the wall, when Jonathan said: "The world is so messed up". Again, his two friends were confused but this time it was because they were thinking exactly the same thing. Even though they had all been in this spot ten years earlier, something was different. They jumped up from the couch and shouted in unison: "We should do something about it!" Ever since, the three friends have worked tirelessly day and night, to give you the best products this world has ever seen.</p>
